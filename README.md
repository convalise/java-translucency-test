## Java Translucency Test

This project is a small study on painting the background of a JPanel with transparent colors for achieving a [translucency effect](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/misc/trans_shaped_windows.html).

The motivation was to learn how to create splash-screen-like windows and how to paint linear gradients and images on a JPanel background for my [Duodecim Renamer](https://github.com/convalise/duodecim-renamer) project.

**Built with Java 7.**
The latest version of JRE/JDK can be found [here](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html).
